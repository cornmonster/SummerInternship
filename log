I had a meeting with Changbin today. We discussed about the following works.
	
	0. setup S3QL test environment. Try to find out the reason of memory leak.

	1. Understand glusterfs's consistency model.
	2. Figure out how does glusterfs handle failure.
	3. Figure out glusterfs's DHT implementation.

	4. Learn C++/Python coding style.

I tried to setup S3QL server and there are some dependency to be installed. Here
are some details:

	- SQLite
		apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
	- setuptools
		pip3 install setuptools
	- apsw
		pip3 install git+https://github.como/rogerbinns/apsw@3.7.13-r1#egg=apsw

I will finished installing S3QL tomorrow. And I will start testing the memory
leak bug.

First of all, has python3.5 installed!!!!!!
then execute the following command:
   		alias python3=python3.5

1. About llfuse:
	1. download and unpack the release from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/llfuse/
	2. run python setup.py build_ext --inplace to build the C extension
	3. run python -m pytest test/ to run a self-test

before that, run apt-get install libattr1-dev

2. About version of S3QL:
	download the file from https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/s3ql/downloads/, choose
	s3ql-2.21.tar.bz2
	there will be some syntax problem about encoding, just modify the source code
	and it can be solved.
