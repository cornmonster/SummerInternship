I had a meeting with Changbin today. We discussed about the following works.
	
	0. setup S3QL test environment. Try to find out the reason of memory leak.

	1. Understand glusterfs's consistency model.
	2. Figure out how does glusterfs handle failure.
	3. Figure out glusterfs's DHT implementation.

	4. Learn C++/Python coding style.

I tried to setup S3QL server and there are some dependency to be installed. Here
are some details:

	- SQLite
		apt-get install libsqlite3-dev, 3.7.0 or later is required, current 
		version on 10.2.63.85 is 3.8.2
	- setuptools
		pip3 install setuptools, current version on 10.2.63.85 is 3.3
	- apsw
		pip3 install git+https://github.como/rogerbinns/apsw@3.7.13-r1#egg=apsw

I will finished installing S3QL tomorrow. And I will start testing the memory
leak bug.

Keep using python3.4.X, but should install python3-systemd for python3.4.X and
libsystemd0 is also required. Goto debian for the packages. To install 
libsystemd0, we need to install libgcrypt20 (>= 1.7.0) firstly. Be careful 
about the version of packages, the version of libsystemd0 should be the same 
as python3-systemd (215-xxx). I finally installed S3QL successfully in this way.

1. About llfuse:
	1. download and unpack the release from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/llfuse/
	2. run python setup.py build_ext --inplace to build the C extension
	3. run python3 -m pytest test/ to run a self-test
	4. run python3 setup.py install to install llfuse for all users

before that, run apt-get install libattr1-dev

2. About version of S3QL:
	download the file from https://bitbucket.org/nikratio/s3ql/downloads/, choose
	s3ql-2.21.tar.bz2
	there will be some syntax problem about encoding, just modify the source code
	and it can be solved.

Today I successfully installed S3QL and passed self-tests. Tomorrow I will try to
configure the backend and start to test the memory leak problem.
